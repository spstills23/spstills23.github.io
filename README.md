# Code-Louisville-Project

This is my portfolio project of my trip I took to Iceland. It is more like a travel blog/photo gallery. This is the basic write up for it with more refined and update photo gallerys to come.

Included:<br><br>
    index.html-main page<br>
    day1.html-day one of trip<br>
    day2.html-day 2 of trip<br><br>
    css folder: <br>style.cc- for main page
                <br>thumbnail-gallery-day1- for gallery of day 1.<br>
                day2.css<br>
    <br>
    img folder: all the img for the website<br><br>
    Font Folder<br><br>
    Js folder: <br>
    index.js- this includes the code for the prompts that display when clicking the logo as well as other elements.<br>
    Daytwo.js-this includes the code for prompts when clicking the logo as well as the code to display the picture slideshow. 



You will notice I used bootstrap for day 1 and 2 for my photo gallery markup but I left the index page without any outside linked code and wanted to do all of that code myself. Day 1 and 2 also inclue Js and Styling with reference to their respective css and Js files for a different look than the main page.
