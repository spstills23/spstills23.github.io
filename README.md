# Code-Louisville-Project

This is my portfolio project of my trip I took to Iceland. It is more like a travel blog/photo gallery. This is the basic write up for it with more refined and update photo gallerys to come.

Included:<br><br>
    index.html-main page<br>
    day1.html-day one of trip<br>
    day2.html-day 2 of trip<br><br>
    css folder: <br>style.cc- for main page
                <br>thumbnail-gallery-day1- for gallery of day 1.<br>
                <br>
    img folder: all the img for the website<br>
    Js folder: <br>
    index.js- this includes the code for the prompts that display when clicking the logo and the day links past the 2nd day.



You will notice I used bootstrap for day 1 and 2 for my photo gallery markup but I left the index page without any outside linked code and wanted to do all of that code myself. Day 1 and 2 also inclue Js and Styling within the html for a different look than the main page.
